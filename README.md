# Traffic-Analyzer

A traffic analyzer uses computer vision and AI to:

Detect different vehicle types (e.g., cars, trucks, bikes) from video footage

Track their movement over time

Count vehicles class-wise (e.g., total cars, total trucks)

Generate real-time statistics (e.g., congestion, traffic flow direction)

Optionally, generate visual dashboards or reports
